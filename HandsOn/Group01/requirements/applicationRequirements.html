<h1>Environmental Stations and Institutions in Madrid</h1>
<h2>Description of the Application</h2>
<p>This application provides a simple, user-friendly interface for exploring environmental conditions and public institutions across specific 
    areas of Madrid — for example, a user’s neighbourhood or locations they plan to visit or are interested on. 

    The goal of the application is to give users quick access to up-to-date environmental and institutional information for a selected area of 
    Madrid. Data is presented in a clear, concise way so users can make informed decisions about safety, accessibility, and environmental quality. 
    In particular, the application will allow users to access information about:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental Measurements:</strong> Data collected from stations monitoring atmospheric weather conditions, acoustic measurements, 
    and air quality in different areas of Madrid.</li>
<li><strong>Institutions in Madrid:</strong> Information about key institutions, such as fire stations, police stations, and government 
    offices, and their locations across the city.</li>
</ul>
<p> All information is linked to geographic references, enabling the aggregation of data from multiple sources to build a comprehensive 
    profile of any selected area. Users can query the system to obtain results such as the nearest institutions of a given type to a location, 
    or the monitoring stations reporting the best or worst environmental conditions in a zone. </p>
<h2>Possible use cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Residents checking local air quality, noise levels and weather conditions before planning activities.</li>
<li>Visitors or workers identifying the nearest emergency services and government offices in an unfamiliar neighbourhood.</li>
<li>Helping users identify areas with better or worse conditions and supporting decisions on urban planning and resource allocation.</li>
</ul>
 
    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search and Filter Options:</strong>
<p>Users should be able to search for specific locations — such as a neighbourhood, district, or a custom area defined by a radius around a 
    point — and request information about institutions or environmental conditions. The system must support filtering based on these criteria 
    to deliver relevant, tailored results.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>View Environmental Data:</strong>
<p>Users will have the option to view detailed measurements from environmental stations. This includes data such as:
<ul>
<li>Weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure)</li>
<li>Acoustic levels (e.g., noise pollution)</li>
<li>Air quality measurements (e.g., NO2, PM10, O3)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the platform could integrate external sources to enrich the data, for example by providing contextual information on 
    pollutants (e.g. whether they pose health risks for people with asthma or are within normal levels) or by issuing alerts when noise 
    measurements exceed regulatory thresholds.</p>
</p>
</li>
<li><strong>View Institutions by Location:</strong>
<p>Users will be able to explore information about institutions (e.g., fire stations, police stations) based on their geographical location 
    in Madrid. Each institution will display details such as its address, contact information, and type of service provided.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Map Integration:</strong>
<p>The application will integrate a map (e.g., using Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) to display the locations of environmental stations and 
    institutions. The map will allow users to click on a location to get more detailed information about the station or institution.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Linkage Between Data Sources:</strong>
<p>The application should be capable of linking environmental data with institution data based on geographic location. For instance, users 
    could see the environmental measurements for a specific district alongside the locations of nearby institutions such as fire stations or 
    government offices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> The application should load quickly and handle large datasets efficiently, especially when users perform 
    searches or interact with the map.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Ensure that data privacy and security measures are implemented when accessing or storing data. Users should not 
    be able to access sensitive or unauthorized information.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The application should be fully accessible, following best practices for web accessibility (WCAG standards).
     This includes support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and mobile responsiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Application User Interface</h2>
<p>

        The user interface will be designed to be simple and intuitive. The following features will be included:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search Bar:</strong> A prominent search bar at the top of the page to allow users to search for stations and institutions based on 
    keywords like "Plaza de España" or "temperature measurement".</li>
<li><strong>Filters:</strong> Filters for narrowing down the search by type of measurement (e.g., acoustic, meteorological, air quality) or type
     of institution (e.g., fire station, police station, government office).</li>
<li><strong>Map View:</strong> A map showing the locations of environmental stations and institutions. Clicking on a marker will display more 
    information about the station or institution.</li>
<li><strong>Data Display:</strong> Upon selecting a station or institution, users will see a detailed view that includes relevant information, 
    such as the measurements collected (for stations) or the institution’s services and contact details (for institutions).</li>
